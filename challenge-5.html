<!-- 

	This is a weather forecast. It shows the location and the dates 
	for a three day forecast. This seems very simple but it could 
	use some thought. 

	All of the information here is related. it's probably an article. 
	The first two lines are probably a header for the rest of the 
	information. 
	The forecast is a list of dates and forecasts.

	A list would work here. HTML provides a special type of list 
	called a definition list <dl>. The definition list uses two 
	parts for every list element a title <dt> and a definition <dd>
	Often a list has title and body for each item. This a definition
	list describes.
